# Quick Start

run vscode extensions by generating `run_vscode.yaml` file.

## Install

Search `Run Code Extension` in the extension explore and install it.

or

run the line in the terminal,

```bash
code --install-extension crimson206.run-code-extension
```

## Run Vscode

generate a file `run_vscode.yaml` and write the content as below:

```yaml
execute: false
vscode:
    - command: runVscode.combinePackageJSON
```

If you are prepared to run the command, replace `false` by `true` and save the file.
This extension will detect the change, and execute the command, and change the bool value into false back.

The `runVscode.combinePackageJSON` will generate two files in the `temp/run_vscode` directory.
1. extension-packages.json
    - generated file by the command `runVscode.combinePackageJSON`
    - collection of the package.json files of all the installed extensions
2. vscode_extension_progress.json
    - generated whenever a command is executed by `run_vscode.yaml` file
    - contains the start and end time of the executed command
    - expected to be useful when programmatically controlling the extension behaviors
