# Core

The `run_vscode.yaml` is the most important element.
This extension detects it and reads its contents to run the vscode extension commands there.

## Syntax

**run_vscode.yaml**
```yaml
execute: true
vscode:
- command: runVscode.combinePackageJSON
- command: editor-capture.captureCurrent
  args:
  - arg1
  - arg2
- command: another.commandName
```

**vscode_extension_progress.json**
```json
[
  {
    "command": "editor-capture.captureCurrent",
    "status": "started",
    "timestamp": 1723839243900
  },
  {
    "command": "editor-capture.captureCurrent",
    "status": "completed",
    "timestamp": 1723839244321
  },
  // ...
]
```


## Process

If `execute` is true (when the file is saved), `Run Code Extension` runs the extension commands written in the file, and the value of `execute` becomes `false`.

To track the progress, it generates `vscode_extension_progress.json` file.

It is designed to report `completed` when the whole process of the command is completed. However, it does not guarantee the expected behavior of commands based on their design.
